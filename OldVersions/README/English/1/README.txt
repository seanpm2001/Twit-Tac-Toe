# Twit-Tac-Toe

`üê¶Ô∏èüÖæÔ∏è‚ùéÔ∏èüíæÔ∏è Twit-Tac-Toe is a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe styled around the recent Twitter name change. It is a test of my GUI program writing skills in Python and other languages.`

A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but whoever wins gets to win the decision if it is Twitter or X.

## Setup

The project is currently not yet functional, but will be a programming exercise to test my skills of writing GUI programs in Python.

The program will use TKinter and Python 3.10. Any version of Python from 3.0 onward should work fine.

The program will first be tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Based on my past Python experience, this means it should work the same on Windows 10 and 11, however, I am not sure about BSD, MacOS, other operating system compatibility (any system that supports Python and TKinter is planned to be supported)

### UNIX-like systems (Linux, MacOS)

Place the `/Twit-Tac-Toe/` directory in your home or user directory (or on any directory on your computer that you have access to, and feel comfortable with) and run TTT.py to play the game.

### Windows 10/Windows 11

Place the `/Twit-Tac-Toe/` directory in your `C://Users/Desktop/` (or on any directory on your computer that you have access to, and feel comfortable with) and run TTT.py to play the game.

## Assets

The game uses 3 primary assets:

- [`X_logo_2023.svg (The new logo of Twitter, player X)`](/Twit-Tac-Toe/Assets/X/X_logo_2023.svg)
- [`TwitterLogoCircular.png (The new logo of Twitter, player O)`](/Twit-Tac-Toe/Assets/O/TwitterLogoCircular.png)
- [`TTT_Board.svg` (a Tic-Tac-Toe board, looks like a hasthag/pound sign)`](/Twit-Tac-Toe/Assets/Board/SVG/TTT_Board.svg)

### Unused/extra assets

See the documentation repository for more information (link is in the section directly below this one)
