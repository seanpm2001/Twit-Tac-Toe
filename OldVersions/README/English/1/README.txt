# Twit-Tac-Toe

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the title section</b></p></summary>

`üê¶Ô∏èüÖæÔ∏è‚ùéÔ∏èüíæÔ∏è Twit-Tac-Toe is a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe styled around the recent Twitter name change. It is a test of my GUI program writing skills in Python and other languages.`

A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but whoever wins gets to win the decision if it is Twitter or X.

Make sure to spread the word of this program. If you use Twitter, use the hashtag #TwitTacToe or #Twit-Tac-Toe . If you use Mastodon or another similar site that supports hashtags/trends, you can use the same hashtags.

## Setup

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the setup section</b></p></summary>

The project is currently not yet functional, but will be a programming exercise to test my skills of writing GUI programs in Python.

The program will use TKinter and Python 3.10. Any version of Python from 3.0 onward should work fine.

The program will first be tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Based on my past Python experience, this means it should work the same on Windows 10 and 11, however, I am not sure about BSD, MacOS, other operating system compatibility (any system that supports Python and TKinter is planned to be supported)

### UNIX-like systems (Linux, MacOS)
